%%HP: T(3)A(D)F(.);
@ Transmit an ASC-encoded object over the serial port.
@ This program depends on the ->ASC program.
@
@ This program is intended to be used when two-way communication
@ is not available. If two-way communication is available, using
@ the Kermit or XMODEM protocol to transfer data will be faster
@ and more reliable.
@
@ Usage:
@  1. Put an object name (e.g. a program name) on top of the stack.
@  2. Execute this program.
